    <h2>Jona</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>My name is Jonathan and am from Kampala, Uganda. </p>
    <p>I love having fun just like putting on a smile on somebody's face, I also love watching movies and playing football too though I prefer playing with one opponent so that I can score more goals. Currently am not married and am doing software development as my major.</p>
    <p>The things I love most about BYU-Idaho is that there is a very big network of support so getting help is easy. I have been yawning for to learn about web design and I think everything will go on well though so far I don't have any idea.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for 7 month now and I realy love this Church. I would love to learn more from my class mates too.</p>
